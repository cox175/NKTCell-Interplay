# NKTCell-Interplay

Here we have uploaded the code to fit cancer cell data for a variety of experiments dealing with NK cell depletion.

The main code for fitting the data set and for generating plots of the fits can be found in NKTCellInterplay.py. Instructions for running the code are commented throughout the file. The data used in the code can be found in cellcounts.csv and subtype_proportions.csv.
